You can cancel your passport immediately by [reporting it online](https://www.loststolenpassport.service.gov.uk/report/passport-holder).

###Help cancelling your passport

[Contact the Passport Adviceline](https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line) if you need help. 

##Get a replacement passport

If you do not need to travel urgently, you can [apply for a replacement passport from the country you’re in](/apply-renew-passport-abroad).

##Emergency travel documents

If you need to travel in the next 6 weeks, you may be able to get an [emergency travel document](/emergency-travel-document) from the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate in the country you’re in. You will have to pay a fee.

You do not also need to report your passport lost or stolen online - you will do it as part of your emergency travel document application.
