##If you’re studying to become a doctor or dentist

The amount you get will change during your course.

In each of your first 4 years, you could get:

- £6,000 [Tuition Fee Loan](/student-finance/new-fulltime-students) to pay for your course

- £8,944 [Maintenance Loan](/student-finance/new-fulltime-students) to pay living costs

In your fifth and sixth years, you could get £2,389 reduced Maintenance Loan. You can also apply for [NHS funding](/nhs-bursaries) and get the following depending on your circumstances:

- NHS Bursary (funding towards your fees and living costs)

- Extra Weeks Allowance
- Practice placement expenses

^ If you're on a 4 year accelerated graduate course, you'll have to apply for an NHS bursary from your second year.

##Extra help

You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college.

You might be able to get [help with the costs of travel for study or work placements](/travel-grants-students-england) as part of your course.

Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.

^Student loans have to be paid back - grants, bursaries and allowances don’t.^
